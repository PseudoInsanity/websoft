            <p>I have very little experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript. CSS the least</p>

            <p>HTML provides the <i>static</i> skeleton of the webpage, structurally how it should look like. CSS
                provides the visual represantion and Javascript gives you the possibility to make a website dynamic,
                meaning it executes code in the browser.</p>

            <p>The browser gets information from the web server using the HTTP protocol. This makes it possible to store
                websites on a server and allows the user to retrieve this information remotely and view it locally.</p>

            <p><strong>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</strong></p>
            <p>Have not had much experience with node or npm but have been using maven package manager for java for a while and I have set up servers with java before.</p>

            <p><strong>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</strong></p>
            <p>I like using JS and these frameworks because I have wanted to learn it for quite some time now and it is really benefitial to learn. On top of that, it is very useful for my thesis work at tretton37, where the coding is in JS.</p>

            <p><strong>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</strong></p>
            <p>Not much of a plan for the assignment. Followed the lectures, did the preparation and puzzled the pieces together to do the assignment. </p>

            <p><strong>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</strong></p>
            <p>I could have reached for a higher grade, but honestly I have a lot of work at the moment so i settled for grade 3.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What is your TIL for this course section?</strong></p>
            <p>I learned how to set up a server using node and learned about how middleware works with express</p>

            <p><strong>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</strong></p>
            <p>Honestly, not my favourite language. I'm not used to this type of programming language and I have a hard time finding motivation to learn it since it is a very old language that I don't think will be that relevant compared to other languages</p>

            <p><strong>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</strong></p>
            <p>There are some object oriented aspects of the language that is very familiar.</p>

            <p><strong>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</strong></p>
            <p>Just as previous tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>What is your TIL for this course section?</strong></p>
            <p>I learned how to do basic backend things in PHP, like connecting to a database, retrieveing data and connecting it to a web page.</p>

            <h2>S06</h2>
            <p><strong>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</strong></p>
            <p>I mean, it's a trend just like everything else and each trend has its purpose. Javascript is becoming increasingly more popular because a lot of tech is moved to the web and web development has never been this big.</p>

            <p><strong>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</strong></p>
            <p>Depending on the task of course, but I don't really see myself doing low level programming. Classic full-stack is my current goal which would mean that I need to master both backend and frontend.
                So any tech stack that is currently relevant and will be relevant in the near future is where I will put my focus.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Compare programming languages:</strong></p>
            <p>I chose to compare PHP and JavaScript (to try to prove my earlier point). Unsurprisingly, JavaScript is more popular. Although PHP still had som lingering popularity that did compete with JavaScript, albeit there being 
                a lot of legacy code that needs to be maintained. Perhaps there is more development happening in PHP that I don't know of. There probably is, what do I know?
            </p>

            <p><strong>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</strong></p>
            <p>Depends on the project. But if they want a webb application I would suggest using the MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js (MERN) stack since it is one of the currently most popular stacks being used for web development</p>

            <p><strong>What is your TIL for this course section?</strong></p>
            <p>That PHP is more popular than I thought?</p>

            <h2>S08</h2>
            <p>Me and Samin Dehghani are doing this assignment together. We chose to analyze tretton37.com, eppnetwork.com and hkr.se. We chose these websites because they hit really close to home.
                Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O9QH9qDB5Bqiv-1G19K96kG6Xvv_h8Xk-C6Vk7GttXc/edit?usp=sharing">link</a> to the Google Spreadsheet. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The overall score was the average of the categories. Out of the three websites tested, HKR had the best overall result, which was interesting to see.
                <br>
                <br>
                Web performance is quite important since the general attention span of an average user is quite low. Mine included. This makes it really important to develop websites that respond quickly. Hence these tools are provided by google.
                <br>
                <br>
                How one could improve their website? I'm not sure, honestly. I'm not a web developer. But I would assume to not pass too many resources to the client side, causing slow render times. And also have a quick and responsive API to not keep the user waiting for data for too long.

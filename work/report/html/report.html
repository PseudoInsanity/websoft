            <p>I have very little experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript. CSS the least</p>

            <p>HTML provides the <i>static</i> skeleton of the webpage, structurally how it should look like. CSS
                provides the visual represantion and Javascript gives you the possibility to make a website dynamic,
                meaning it executes code in the browser.</p>

            <p>The browser gets information from the web server using the HTTP protocol. This makes it possible to store
                websites on a server and allows the user to retrieve this information remotely and view it locally.</p>

            <p>Here is the <a href="schools.html">link</a> for the list of schools.
            <br>
            I went for grade 5 here, but I believe that one part is not sufficient for grade 5 but lets hope. For grade 4 I have the person sittin on a toilet in the corner of each page. He is draggable and after you release the click, he will dissapear for 2 seconds and then reappear.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also implemented the flags by only using CSS.
            <br>
            For grade 5 the user has the option to choose from 3 municipalities to view the schools. The javascript code is using a fetch request on an api from the internet. The flags are also hideable if you click on them or on the buttons on the top of the page.

            <p><strong>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</strong></p>
            <p>Have not had much experience with node or npm but have been using maven package manager for java for a while and I have set up servers with java before.</p>

            <p><strong>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</strong></p>
            <p>I like using JS and these frameworks because I have wanted to learn it for quite some time now and it is really benefitial to learn. On top of that, it is very useful for my thesis work at tretton37, where the coding is in JS.</p>

            <p><strong>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</strong></p>
            <p>Not much of a plan for the assignment. Followed the lectures, did the preparation and puzzled the pieces together to do the assignment. </p>

            <p><strong>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</strong></p>
            <p>I could have reached for a higher grade, but honestly I have a lot of work at the moment so i settled for grade 3.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What is your TIL for this course section?</strong></p>
            <p>I learned how to set up a server using node and learned about how middleware works with express</p>

            <p><strong>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</strong></p>
            <p>Honestly, not my favourite language. I'm not used to this type of programming language and I have a hard time finding motivation to learn it since it is a very old language that I don't think will be that relevant compared to other languages</p>

            <p><strong>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</strong></p>
            <p>There are some object oriented aspects of the language that is very familiar.</p>

            <p><strong>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</strong></p>
            <p>Just as previous tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>What is your TIL for this course section?</strong></p>
            <p>I learned how to do basic backend things in PHP, like connecting to a database, retrieveing data and connecting it to a web page.</p>

            <h2>S06</h2>
            <p><strong>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</strong></p>
            <p>I mean, it's a trend just like everything else and each trend has its purpose. Javascript is becoming increasingly more popular because a lot of tech is moved to the web and web development has never been this big.</p>

            <p><strong>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</strong></p>
            <p>Depending on the task of course, but I don't really see myself doing low level programming. Classic full-stack is my current goal which would mean that I need to master both backend and frontend.
                So any tech stack that is currently relevant and will be relevant in the near future is where I will put my focus.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Compare programming languages:</strong></p>
            <p>I chose to compare PHP and JavaScript (to try to prove my earlier point). Unsurprisingly, JavaScript is more popular. Although PHP still had som lingering popularity that did compete with JavaScript, albeit there being 
                a lot of legacy code that needs to be maintained. Perhaps there is more development happening in PHP that I don't know of. There probably is, what do I know?
            </p>

            <p><strong>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</strong></p>
            <p>Depends on the project. But if they want a webb application I would suggest using the MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js (MERN) stack since it is one of the currently most popular stacks being used for web development</p>

            <p><strong>What is your TIL for this course section?</strong></p>
            <p>That PHP is more popular than I thought?</p>

            <p>.NET is the framework for C#. This is where the language gets its popularity. It is a very big and supported framework, which makes sense since Microsoft is behind this behemoth.
                What this means is that .NET contains a large amount of methods and interfaces that makes it so popular and easy to work with. 
                C# is just the syntax language being used, which is very similar to Java, or any OOP language.
                <br>
                <br>
                The .NET framework itself is not something we have been working with in this course since we have been using the web application framework ASP.NET which is more comparable to the other technologies we have been using. Personally, I feel that NodeJS and other JS frameworks are simpler to use for web development.
                I didn't quite like the ASP.NET approach to this since it was very many files which I wasnt used to. NodeJS and Express keeps it short and consice.
                <br>
                <br>
                This time around I just wanted to get it done, since again, a lot of other stuff going on. But I looked at some videos, documentation on how to do it and tried to puzzle the pieces together. I'm content with the result since I only aimed for grade 3.

            <p>Me and Samin Dehghani are doing this assignment together. We chose to analyze tretton37.com, eppnetwork.com and hkr.se. We chose these websites because they hit really close to home.
                Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O9QH9qDB5Bqiv-1G19K96kG6Xvv_h8Xk-C6Vk7GttXc/edit?usp=sharing">link</a> to the Google Spreadsheet. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The overall score was the average of the categories. Out of the three websites tested, HKR had the best overall result, which was interesting to see.
                <br>
                <br>
                Web performance is quite important since the general attention span of an average user is quite low. Mine included. This makes it really important to develop websites that respond quickly. Hence these tools are provided by google.
                <br>
                <br>
                How one could improve their website? I'm not sure, honestly. I'm not a web developer. But I would assume to not pass too many resources to the client side, causing slow render times. And also have a quick and responsive API to not keep the user waiting for data for too long.

            <p>
                Answer:<br>
                I assume that the most common security flaw in web applications is using HTTP instead of HTTPS. This directly correlates to number 6 on OWASPs list. Using SSL over an HTTP connection is fundamental nowadays when creating websites.
                One other thing that happens more often than it should, is inproper storage of sensitive data. Sometimes as bad as storing password in plain text (not only web applications), and sometimes as just not have any encryption at all.
                The third thing that I believe many overlook when creating web applications is broken authentication. 
                Poorly handled sessions and authentication can cause manipulation of sessions leading attackers to enter parts of a website they do not have permission to.
                <br>
                <br>
                Solution:
                Using HTTPS will increase security of your website and prevent sensitive information to leak.
                Speaking of sensitive information, not storing users password in plain text can heavily increase security on your website. Using encryption on sensitive data will also inevitably increase security of your website.
                Using multi-factor authentication is a good way to prevent other people to access your website with someone elses credentials. Implementing weak-password checks can also give the user a bigger incentive to put in an effort on their password so no one tries to use "password" as their password.
                <br>
                <br>

            <h2>S10</h2>
            <p>The project was implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) where the frontend was in React. I was responsible for the frontend as well as Samin. 
                <br>
                The biggest problem I believe was learning the logic behind React. Creating components is made very easy, especially when you use a framework like material-ui, like we did. But when it comes to the logic aspect (hooks, states etc), it can get a bit confusing and very different from what we have learned.
                <br>
                So while the idea of the app itself was quite simple, and someone with React experience might have finished it in two days, for us it was quite difficult since there was a lot to learn over a short time. So a lot of time was spent on trying to understand how it works.
                <br>
                But creating the components was made very easy by material-ui. They have already ready components that you can use and customise.
                <br>
                All in all, it was a reasonable project to create during this time. It could always have been better and I wish that we would have done even more, but the grass is always greener on the other side I guess. The teamwork was good. The backend guys knew what needs to be done and all of us have done projects before so we know how we work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The course in general was very very good. I liked the structure with the weekly tasks and not having too much theory but instead get a lot of hands on experience.
                <br>
                It was very helpful that the teacher was flexible during this quite bizarre time very early on. But it is a shame that this course came at the same time as the thesis since I would've liked to spend more time on learning web development.
                The content was good but I do have some pointers on some aspects. For example: I think that learning three languages (two of them very little) was not very benefitial since the learning curve a bit steeper than it had to be. It would have been nicer to only focus on Javascript and maybe some frontend and backend frameworks that are popular (Express and Node were two good examples).
                <br>
                In conclusion, I am very satisfied with the course. We haven't had that much fun in a course in a long time. Moslty because the teacher was very engaged. I would recommend this course to other people. 8/10.
                <br>
                Final TIL:
                I learned how to develop in Javascript. I learned React (on my own though) and I learned a lot more about tools in web development (using the devtools for example).

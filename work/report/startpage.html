                <p>I have very little experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript. CSS the least</p>
                
                <p>HTML provides the <i>static</i> skeleton of the webpage, structurally how it should look like. CSS provides the visual represantion and Javascript gives you the possibility to make a website dynamic, meaning it executes code in the browser.</p>
                
                <p>The browser gets information from the web server using the HTTP protocol. This makes it possible to store websites on a server and allows the user to retrieve this information remotely and view it locally.</p>

            <p>My name is Edmir Suljic, born i Örebro in 1996. I moved to Malmö in 1999 and have been there ever since. I graduated from Malmö Borgarskola in 2015 and took a break for 2 years where I worked a bit.</p>
    
            <p>I have always been interested in computers (like everyone else in here I suppose), but did not even consider studying programming until late 2016 when my friend who is a programmer suggested it.</p>
    
            <p>My hobbies mostly include music. I play guitar, have been for 7 years. I suppose it would be my main passion but unfortunately it does not always pay the bills so programming it is.</p>
    
            <p>I do like to try new things all the time, but sticking to it might be the biggest challenge. Maybe it's a generational thing.</p>

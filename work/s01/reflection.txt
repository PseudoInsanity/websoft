My name is Edmir.
I have had some experience prior to this course with Git, Github and Markdown languages. 
However I have not have any experience with GitHub Pages but I will surely use it from now on. Pretty useful.
I have not really created any websites before. I have done some tutorials on React, and some basic html websites. I would not consider it "making a website", there is much to learn.
My experiences with web development are not many. As previously mentioned, I have dabbled in the concept and I suppose I have some fundamental understanding for the conepts (Thanks to Reddit).
I have some experience with web servers and REST API, but only under Java, not Node.js or any other framework.
TIL:
    GitHub Pages is a pretty sweet way to post websites with easy hosting. Perhaps not what you want if you have a real website, but it is good enough for this context.
    Git bash is way more efficient than any GUI or integrated VC in an IDE.
